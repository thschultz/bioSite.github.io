                <p>Kim Schultz was born in Kansas and moved to Nebraska at an early age. He went to high school at
                    Ralston High School in Ralston, Nebraska. Coming from a family of carpenters, Kim immediately took a
                    job being his dad’s right-hand man. After his dad suffered a series of heart attacks, Kim took a job
                    at local dealership as a service manager. </p>

            <div class="column content">
                <p>

                    He met his wife at a mutual friend’s wedding and were married shortly after they met. Kim and his
                    wife quickly had 4 children, all boys, and moved to a small town in Nebraska. Kim was offered a
                    service manager position and continued that for 10 years. Kim was introduced to the world of
                    insurance sales from an old high school friend of his. His friend offered him a job as a travelling
                    insurance salesman. He would sell medicare supplements, life insurance, and other supplementary
                    insurance for ten years.

                    After travelling all across the state of Nebraska, Kim stopped travelling to spend more time with
                    his wife. He became a mailman so every night he would be home. Kim retired at the age of 59 to help
                    with his cancer-ill wife until her passing. Kim moved to Oklahoma late of 2021 to spend time with
                    his extended family.

                    In Oklahoma, he enjoys his family, fishing, and hunting. Kim plans to spend his retirement down and
                    travel as much possible. Hoping to see places he has never seen before and do so until his body
                    can’t stand to travel anymore. </p>
