                <p>Kim has a lot of hobbies. His first hobby would be woodworking. His father was a carpenter and would
                    build and install custom cabinets for the Omaha Metropolitan Area. He loved seeing his work slowly
                    come together and seeing how happy their customers would be with the final outcome. His stand also
                    taught him how to fish and hunt. When work was slow or they had time off, they would find time to
                    make it out to the lake to fish or out on their family farm to hunt.</p>

                <p>When he got older, he joined a club that taught how to ride a horse. He would immediately fall in
                    love and has been doing it ever since that day. In his earlier days, he would learn basic riding and
                    would soon enough compete at local fairs in barrel racing. He would introduce all four of his
                    children to this hobby with only two really catching on and enjoying it. With this hobby, he would
                    meet a lot of people who shared the same passion. He would later meet a gentleman who introduced him
                    to Cowboy Mounting Shooting. This is a competitive sport where people ride horses while shooting
                    targets. Kim fell in love with this sport and joined a club to compete almost all summer.</p>

                <p>He would meet someone who worked in Hollywood and asked him to bring his two sons down to New Mexico
                    to be part of a motion picture. Kim took his two sons down there and spent three weeks being part of
                    the movie The Lone Ranger. His continues his love for horseback riding in Oklahoma. He takes his
                    only horse now, Ringo, riding up and down the river almost every week.</p>
